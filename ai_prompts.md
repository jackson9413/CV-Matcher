## Model
I want to compare job discription and CVs/Resumes to pick up the CV matched the job description the most. Which model I need to use to achieve that goal?
## Python
Can you show me an example how I can use Python to do it?
## Flask
How can I develop a web application using Flask to implement it so users can upload one PDF file or multiple PDF files, then it shows matching score of the CV(s)?
